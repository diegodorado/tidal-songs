1
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:06,630
From this distant vantage point

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,730
the Earth might not seem of any particular interest.

3
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,210
But for us it's different.

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,980
Consider again that dot.

5
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,430
That's here. That's home. That's us.

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,370
On it,

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:23,390
everyone you love,
On it,

8
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,680
everyone you love,

9
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,470
everyone you know,

10
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,600
everyone you ever heard of,

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,770
every human being who ever was lived out their lives.

12
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,460
The aggregate our joy and suffering,

13
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,520
thousands of confident religions ideologies and economic doctrines,

14
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:44,350
every hunter and forager,

15
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,780
every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization,

16
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,440
every king and peasant,

17
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:55,400
every young couple in love, every mother and father,

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:59,130
hopeful child, inventor and explorer,

19
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:02,820
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,150
every superstar, every supreme leader,

21
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,800
every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there,

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:13,750
on the mote of dust 

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,070
suspended in a sunbeam.

24
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,630
The Earth is a very small stage

25
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:24,920
in a vast cosmic arena.

26
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,540
Think of the rivers of blood

27
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,170
spilled by all those generals and emperors,

28
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,430
so that in glory and triumph they could become the momentary masters

29
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,490
of a fraction of a dot.

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:47,410
Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel 

31
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:52,360
on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,390
How frequent their misunderstandings?

33
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,110
How eager they are to kill one another?

34
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,220
How fervent their hatreds?

35
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:07,180
Our posturings, our imagined self-importance,

36
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:11,340
the delusion that we have some privileged position in the universe,

37
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,000
are challenged by this point of pale light.

38
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:18,130
Our planet

39
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:24,100
is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,990
In our obscurity,

41
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:29,250
in all this vastness,

42
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:33,150
there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere 

43
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,360
to save us from ourselves.

44
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,790
The Earth the only world known so far to harbor life.

45
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,920
There is nowhere else at least in the near future

46
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,500
to which our species could migrate.

47
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,110
Visit?

48
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,390
Yes.

49
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:51,040
Settle?

50
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,620
Not yet.

51
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:55,720
Like it or not, for the moment,

52
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:58,630
the Earth is where we make our stand.

53
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,320
It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,880
character-building experience.

55
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:09,210
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits

56
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,300
than this distant image of our tiny world.

57
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,430
To me,

58
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:20,270
It underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another 

59
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,390
and to preserve and cherish 

60
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:24,710
the Pale Blue Dot.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,170
The only home, we've ever known.
